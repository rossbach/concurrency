How to compile KMeans
=====================

This is a retelling of what I did to compile this (and related) projects. Hopefully this is useful to others as well.

- set to Debug/x64 (instead of the default win32)
- update the project file, changing "Cuda 4.2.props" to "Cuda 5.0.props" since that's the version I have
- delete C:\SVC\Dandelion\accelerators\kmeans\cuda\shared\lib\x64\shrUtils64D.lib (it's a result of the compilation yet it's checked in)
- delete C:\SVC\Dandelion\accelerators\kmeans\cuda\common\lib\x64\cutil64D*
- change lpszInputFile in main.cpp to be relative, so it works regardless of where we put the repo files.
